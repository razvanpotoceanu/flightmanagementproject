Project 1 - Flight Management Application (Basic Structure)

Project Goal and Architecture

The primary goal of this first phase was to establish the basic architecture of a Spring Boot application following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with a clear separation of layers: Model – Repository – Service – Controller.

Data Persistence: All data is stored In-Memory using Java Collections (Map), as required. No database connection is used.

Design Decisions (Requirement 6)

A. Repository Implementation (DRY Principle)

Decision: We implemented a generic abstract class InMemoryRepository<T>. This class centralizes the core CRUD logic (save, findAll, findById, delete) using a ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe in-memory storage.

Justification: This adheres to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, as specific repositories (e.g., PassengerRepository) only need to extend this generic class.

B. Controller Organization (SRP Principle)

Decision: We chose to implement one dedicated Controller per main entity (e.g., PassengerController, FlightController).

Justification: This organization ensures clear API path organization and maintains the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), making the application easier to extend in future phases.

Model Extensions (Requirement 5)

As required by point 5, the following 1-2 new properties or structural changes were added to models:

Staff: Added the email and personalId fields to the abstract class.

Luggage: Implemented LuggageStatus as an Enum (CHECKED_IN, LOST, etc.) for type-safe status tracking instead of a simple string.

Date/Time: All date attributes (e.g., in Flight) utilize LocalDate (or appropriate Java Time API types) to adhere to Clean Code conventions.

How to Run the Application

The project is built using Gradle.

Ensure JDK 17 is correctly configured in your IntelliJ IDEA environment.

Open the terminal (PowerShell on Windows) in the project root directory (e.g., .../flightmanagement).

Execute the following command:

.\gradlew.bat bootRun

Test Endpoints
The application starts on port 8080.

Connectivity Test: Access http://localhost:8080/hello (should return: Die Anwendung funktioniert!).

API Structure Test: The Passenger API is available at http://localhost:8080/api/passengers (after implementing the respective Controller).
